            About this site

        <p>
            I'm using this site to learn and practice web development skills. It doesn't look like much, because I'm trying to build it from the ground up, without using tools like Squarespace or Wordpress. I'm more interested in building apps and doing analysis than in building a website per se, so I plan to use this as a place to host these projects, rather than a place to show off design skills.
        </p>

            So far, aside from the basic HTML and CSS, I have deployed this site via AWS, and an managing the (megre) code base in Github. The git for this project is <a href="https://github.com/stevehind/stevehind.github.io">here</a>. I'd love any feedback on how I'm managing it.

        <p>
            I have two immediate priorities for this site:
            <li>Customize the CSS a bit more</li>
            <li>Build a simple app to sit on this site. I'm currently learing AngularJS for this, but am open to better approaches.</li>
        </p>
